# Examples

This folder contains example scripts for the **simulation** and analysis of the
double pendulum, acrobot and pendubot and the controllers.

The scripts are grouped into subfolders:

### analysis

This folder contains scripts for the analysis, e.g. system identification,
region of attraction estimation, ...

### benchmarks

This folder contains scripts to perform the benchmark experiments for
controllers.

### ideal

This folder contains simulation scripts for the ideal, mathematical double
pendulum. These simulation do not contain noise and the model parameters are
assumed to be perfectly accurate.

### paper

This folder contains all scripts that have been used to obtain the results
which are presented in the paper.

### parameter\_optimization

This folder contains scrips to optimize cost parameters of controllers and
trajectory optimization.

### realistic

This folder contains simulation scripts for more realistic conditions.
The simulations contain noise and the model parameters parsed to the controller
can vary from the real model parameters.

### reimplemented\_papers

This folder contains scripts which (try to) recreate the results from other
papers.
