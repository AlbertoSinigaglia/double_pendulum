# Scripts for Recreating Paper Results

This folder contains all scripts that were used to produce the results that can
be found in the paper.

Note: The scripts, which rely on data from other scripts (e.g. the plotting
scripts) use the data stored in the /data folder of this repository by default.
So all scripts can be run independently.

Note: The scripts with names starting with 'experiment_' are the scripts used
in the hardware experiments.
